# [WIP] Music Recommendation Engine

Prototype for a music recommendation engine based purely on musical attributes.

## Getting started

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate it on Windows:

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Or with Bash (Mac OS/Linux):

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, run a development server:

```
flask run --host=0.0.0.0
```
